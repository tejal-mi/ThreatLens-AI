# OAuth Login Routes

Base path: `/tc-auth`

Authentication:

- These routes are part of the browser OAuth flow and are public.
- The callback endpoints use the session cookie set by the OAuth client, so the browser must preserve cookies during the flow.

Flow notes:

- `/google/login` and `/github/login` redirect the browser to the provider authorization page.
- The callback endpoints exchange the provider code, create or link the local account, and then redirect to the frontend callback URL with `access_token` in the query string.
- `frontend_url` is stored in the session during the login step and reused during the callback.

Common response:

- Login endpoints return a redirect response rather than JSON.
- Callback endpoints also return a redirect response rather than JSON.
